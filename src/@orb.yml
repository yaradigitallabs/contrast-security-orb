  Install and configure/use Contrast Security on CircleCI
  The Contrast agent begins securing your code by adding sensors to the entire software stack of your applications - from runtime to custom code - to directly measure vulnerabilities and attacks. Contrast Assess continuously monitors all your code, including your libraries, for known and unknown vulnerabilities, and produces accurate results without dependence on application security experts.
